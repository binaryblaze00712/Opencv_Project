# Opencv_Project

**You need to download the .exe file and the .dll in same folder to run the project**

This project captures a short video from the webcam using opencv in a cpp program.
You need to login with username=himanshu and password=00712 to start recording the video. 
From each frame in the video, only the red channel is extracted thus in the video green and blue components are zero.
A gaussian filter is also applied to the video before saving.
The recorded video is saved in the same folder where you put the exe file.
